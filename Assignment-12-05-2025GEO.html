    <p>Anita Shape (Theme: Geometrical Fantasy)
By Beth G. Miranda

	Prologue
	It was a clear day in the plane ABC, and rays of sun US and UN were beaming on the grid. Anita Shape and her mom were living in a set of supplementary angles. Anita is a square with a width of one unit. She knows her XYZ’s, her coordinates, and the history of the plane ABC. One day, she was reading a book when she heard about a plane, plane DEF, that intersects ABC. She asked her parents to go to the intersection, but they said no. But Anita was destined to go to plane DEF, so she packed her bags and began the journey to the intersection: Line DE at (1000, 6) on the plane.
	“I’m ready to go!” said Anita as she hiked to line segment GH, which the points called “the Ledge.” It was known as this because beyond it, you were no longer in the Neighborhood, and you were susceptible to being used by geometry teachers in math problems. She took a deep breath, filling her area with air. She jumped off of the segment.

	<b>Chapter</b> 1

	“Ahhh…,” said Anita as she entered the woods that seemed endless. “I feel safe here.” Little did she know that she was walking into the dwelling of the Evil Points, points Q and U. The Evil Points had a special method of luring in points. They would make themselves into a line segment and offer compliments. When the target point arrived, point Q, who was always the vertex, would form a line segment with the target and make a pair of complementary angles, which would be doomed to be angles that would never return to the Neighborhood. They could do this because of the Great Point, which helps form the angle UQGreat Point. The Great Point was once a Neighborhood leader. He was respected far and wide because he was formed by the x and y axes. When the axes collided, part of the energy split off to form the Great Point. He could form angles that he wasn’t a part of. For example, he formed the supplementary angles that Anita’s family live in. Mathematics textbooks have it that the Great Point is an arch-angle. This doesn’t mean that he is an angle, nor that his sides curve. It means that he was once coplanar with angle GOD, which has nothing to do with point G of the Ledge. Angle GOD is on a different plane, plane HEA. (It can also be described as plane AVN) Plane HEA is parallel to plane ABC. 
Due to being an arch-angle, the Great Point was a prime target of the evil that lurked on plane ABC. Long ago, when points were not known by the Math-Doers, the Great Point was offered fame. He was offered a spot on a geometry worksheet, which would make the event the first time the Geometric Race was revealed to the Three Dimensionists, aka the Math-Doers. Not knowing how much trouble he was getting himself into, he agreed. This was all a lie, as you probably expected, and the Point was forever trapped in the angle of the Evil Points, but it did get the Geometric Race revealed to the Math-Doers.
“Hey, handsome point! Who are you?” said Anita.
“I’m the Great Point, and I was lured here by those other points and trapped in here, and I assume my curse lasts forever,” said the Great Point.
“What curse?” said Anita.
“Just the most powerful curse of our time. I have been cursed into an angle with the evil points.”
“Oh Angle GOD! We have to help you, Great Point!” said Anita.
“I’m sorry, I can’t be saved except by true love’s intersection,” said the Great Point. “That’s when a line that truly loves you goes through you.”
“Oh, I bet I could find a line,” said Anita.
“All the lines are at the 900s on the x-axis, and there are geometrical dragons past 500 x,” said the Great Point. “And you can’t go up, because figures that go past the line y=10 are doomed to Angle DIE.”
“Oh, I wasn’t going to do that, because I know the dangers that lie beyond 10 y. What’s Angle DIE, though?”
“Only the most painful angle EVA! Wait, wrong angle. I meant to say that Angle DIE is an angle that all figures end up coplanar with. It is on plane PUR and on that plane, you can’t move. And you’ll instantly become coplanar with angle DIE if you go past 10 y.”
“That’s terrible!” said Anita Shape. “And your situation is too. I’m gonna go find you your line, and I’ll drop you a line if I do. Get it?”
“AH, I was gotten by Angle PUN again!”
Just as Anita was on her way, she realized she forgot one of her bags! It had very little of her stuff in it, but she needed it to explore more.

<b>Chapter</b> 2: Trouble At Home

Anita went back to the Ledge and climbed up. Just as she was about to get the bag, her mom appeared.
“I am making you round! In other words, you’re rounded! Go to your room!” said her mom.
Anita’s mom was named Dad, because math is weird. Mrs. Dad was a very nice line segment. She had a length of 1, and her midpoint never growled out of hunger. Her husband was a different story, though. Her husband liked to go by his mathematical name, Line Segment NO. We’ll just call him NO. NO had a length of 3, and never could find enough food to fill his midpoint. They always argued, and were very angry. For this reason, Anita was afraid to come anywhere near her room’s door.
“WA WA WA WA,” sobbed Anita.
While Anita is sobbing, let me give you a history lesson. There are 2 sides to Plane ABC’s history, the 3D one and the 2D one. I partially explained the 2D one, and I will now expand on the 3D one.
Plane ABC was founded in the year 67 AD when a student named Boltzersan left out his loose leaf paper that he drew lines on while making a paper chess set. The first point that existed on Plane ABC was named Boolean B V C Voltensnatch, and he was made when another student, named Likbertagia, dropped her pencil on the piece of paper, where it landed tip-side down on the origin and drew a point. Boolean Voltensnatch loved to doodle, so he doodled Anita’s home along with other stuff. He also doodled more points. Eventually he became known as “the Great Point” and garnered respect far and wide. And so we come to now. And it looks like Anita has stopped sobbing.
“Alright Anita, you can come out now,” said Anita’s mom.
“Okay,” said Anita.
“And also dinner is ready,” said Anita’s mom.
“Oh goody, Cheeri-Angles!” said Anita. It was Friday, and Anita and her mom always had Cheeri-Angles together on Fridays.
“I’ll be down when you are! That’s the point of motherly love! Get it? Point?” said Anita’s mom.
“Nice one, Mom!” said Anita.

<b>Chapter</b> 3: That’s the Point

When Anita came downstairs, she saw her little bowl of Cheeri-Angles cereal with h1y (honey) and milk. Her mom had grilled bov-line segmoont steak with sauce that was just Plane ASM! (plain awesome)
“So, Mom, I have something to tell you,” said Anita Shape.
“What?” asked her mom.
“The Great Point is trapped and I want to save him,” said Anita.
"That sounds like fake news. Where, exactly, did you hear this from?” said her mom
“The woods,” said Anita.
“The woods beyond 15 x?! Oh, absolutely not. How are you still alive?”
“Well, I’m a square, and the dangers out there only affect points, so lucky me, I guess,” said Anita.
“That’s besides the point. If you survived the woods, then maybe you could go find my lost love!” said Anita’s mom.
“Lost love?” said Anita.
“Long ago, I had this beautiful, nice, handsome young point for a husband. His name was James, and he never argued. I had you with him. One day, he went to go get the milk. 3 days later, I saw on the news that he had gone to (857, 5) on the plane and got himself lost. I had to go get a new husband after that, and thus, you have your current dad.”
“That’s both terrible and amazing! It’s terrible because you lost your love, and it’s amazing because I can save him!”
“Okay, you can go after this one question: Why did you go into the woods in the first place?”
“I heard about an intersecting plane, and I wanted to go there,” said Anita.
“A plane that intersects ABC? How could that exist? I have a lot of questions, but this will be my last question for now: How is the Great Point trapped, and how are you going to save him?”
“The Great Point is trapped in an angle with the evils of the forest. The only thing that can save him is true love’s intersection, which is when a line that truly loves a point goes through that point. All the lines are at 900 x, though, and there are dragons past 500 x.”
“Good luck,” said Anita’s mom.
And with that, Anita was on her way to: the Great Point’s freedom, Line DE, her mom’s lost love, and the pantry to pack some snacks.
“Okay, just need some chips, some Cheez-Points, some fruit, some vegetables, and that’s pretty much it for snacks. I pretty much have my bag packed otherwise, so back to the Ledge I go! Bye Mom!” Anita said.
Little did she know that she did not pack all of her things.
“Love you!” Anita’s mom said.

<b>Chapter</b> 4: A Journey Begins

When Anita jumped off the Ledge, she felt she needed to use the bathroom.
“Aw boy, I really need a quick sit-down to dislodge my poop and pee,” Anita said. “But I forgot my toilet paper!”
Just then, a handsome young point came up to Anita.
“Hey beautiful square,” said the point. “I’m Jackson.”
“Um, hey I guess? I really need to go to the bathroom right now. My name’s Anita, by the way,” said Anita.
“Well, you’re in luck! There’s a bathroom that I made not too long ago a couple units from here,” said Jackson.
“You make bathrooms?” asked Anita.
“Um, yeah, I do. I enjoy building things quite a lot,” said Jackson.
Anita went to the bathroom without washing her hands. Jokes on you, she doesn’t have hands! She did the geometrical equivalent: diving in a conveniently placed tub of soap.
“I’m done, Jackson,” said Anita.
They had lost each other for a couple of seconds. Anita’s brain was racing with thoughts. What if she had just lost her boyfriend? What if Jackson knew where Mom’s lost love was? What if Jackson WAS Mom’s lost love? What if life is a lie? But, after 5 seconds:
“Hey Anita,” said Jackson.
“Heyy, Jackson-cutie,” said Anita. They had just met, and now Anita was calling Jackson “cutie”?
“Oh, seems like you like me already? It seems like all signs point to a marriage,” said Jackson. “Get it? Point?”
“No thanks. Maybe in five years.”
“No thanks? But, but why?”
“There’s this movie from the real world called Frozen, and one of its lines is, ‘You can’t marry a man you just met.’,” said Anita.
“Oh, everyone knows to not trust the real world. In geometrical love, anything is possible! Come, bring it in, gimme a big hug!”
Anita and Jackson hugged each other for more than a few seconds. (And if you’re wondering how geometrical figures hug, don’t ask me)
“Okay, this is getting awkward,” said Anita as she escaped from the hug.
“Well, it was nice talking to you,” said Jackson. “I better get going, though.”
“Wait, Jackson!” said Anita.
“Sorry?”
“Would you like to join my quest?” asked Anita.
“Sure, what is it?”
“I’m going on a quest to, uhh, find my mom’s lost love,” said Anita.
“Love? I know all about love,” said Jackson.
“You seem like the perfect fit then! You’re on the team!” said Anita.
And they were happily on their way, but not without a close shave with point Q.
“Mwahaha! Gimme all yer stuff!” said Point Q.
But Jackson had one better: wit.
“I’ll tell him point jokes while you go escape! To point you in the right direction, look for the right angle with a vertex with a y value of 5 and sides of Ray LI and LY!”
Anita ran for that door, and when she got there, Jackson had outwitted Point Q, and they were back together again.
The door was made out of metal and looked industrial.  Beside it was a sign that said 100 x. When it opened, Anita saw some line segments. But, these ones were different. They were moving! And not moving like living figures do, no, these looked like inanimate objects! But Anita and Jackson were not afraid of anything.
“I got your back and you got mine!” said Anita.
“Shapes in shape and lines in line!” said Jackson. “I made that up just now. Pretty good, huh?”

<b>Chapter</b> 5: The Factory

When Anita and Jackson went through the door, they saw a big beefy circle.
“Hello there, fellows, my name is Bart,” said the circle.
“I was just wondering how I could get through this factory with my friend Jackson,” said Anita.
“I’m sorry, the only way through the factory is through the machines,” said Bart, “and those machines press with a force greater than 10 school buses, 50 boulders, one elephant, and one feather all combined. Basically an elephant and some change, though, if you ask me,” said Bart. “But I can give you a toy! We have a lot of toys!”
“Bart, we don’t need a toy right now,” said Anita.
“Ooh, RC car! Vroom vroom!” said Jackson.
“Jackson, stop acting like a 5 year old.”
Just then, Jackson’s RC car got stuck in a machine’s circuitry, preventing it from working.
“Do you see what that kid is doing?” said Bart. “He found a way for you guys to escape!”
“Really?” said Anita.
“Really,” said Bart.
Just then, Anita saw an opening. She dashed through it.
“Jackson, keep playing with those RC cars!” said Anita.
“Okay. I like having fun, after all,” said Jackson.
The machines whirred, obviously trying to best Jackson and his RC car game. But Jackson was too good. Car after car, Jackson stuffed each one up a machine’s inner workings. It seemed to be working, until one machine came alive.
“Anita Shape, you will succumb to my jaws, and no RC car can stop me!” it said.
Just then, Jackson pulled out a special RC car, from the brand NO. She was driving it when she said “Pester it with jokes, my car is almost there!”
“Hey machine, what do you fix if your car clucks?” said Anita.
“I don’t know,” the machine said.
“You fix its hengine!” said Anita.
All of a sudden, a clank rang out.
“Oh, my parts, I can’t feel them! Whirr-zz-zz-zz,” said the machine.
“Yeah! We did it!!” said Anita.
“We did it, but there’s still a slight problem: I can’t get over to you, because some kind of safety mechanism must have triggered, and now the floor between us is covered in spikes,” said Jackson.
“That is a problem…   …that I just solved!’ said Anita
“How?” said Jackson.
“There’s a door here, so come through when I open it!”
Jackson went through the door to reach Anita.
“Yes!” Jackon said. “And there’s another door up ahead.”
Jackson realized he had to go to the bathroom while they were heading towards the door.
“Aw man oh man oh man do I need to tinkle!” said Jackson. “But luckily I brought my building stuff, so I should be able to build a bathroom in this empty space.”
Jackson built a bathroom. Little did he know that he was not allowed to build bathrooms inside the factory.
“Stop right there, Mr. Rulebreaker!” said a cop.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it-  Wait, I still have a car left!”
Jackson used his last RC car to knock the cop into the spikes. That was the last of the cops of Bart’s factory, for they are very clumsy line segments. He then took a pee.
“Yes! Love that feeling. Don’t you, Anita?”
“Yeah, I do,” said Anita.
This door looked like it could be a building door. Above it was a sign that read 150 x. They opened the door and saw a city made up of line segments. It had tall buildings and small homes. Something about it made Jackson perk up.
“There are probably bathrooms there! I don’t have to build any more bathrooms!” said Jackson.
“And I can buy a T-shirt!” said Anita.
“You ready?” said Jackson.
“I was drawn ready!” said Anita.
They went through the door into the city.

<b>Chapter</b> 6: The City

Anita and Jackson came out of the factory onto a sidewalk. They saw a school that had a sign that said, “Point Anatomy - What Points Are. Now Free!”
“Should we go?” said Anita.
“Of course! I’ve never learned what points truly are. And we just have to cross the street to get to it!” said Jackson.
They went to school and met the teacher. She was a triangle, and she was very beautiful.
“Hi,” she said, “I’m Ms. Beighleigh.”
“Well hello, Ms. Bailey, it’s a pleasure to meet- Wait, WHAT’S that name on your name tag? It looks like puke!” said Anita.
“It does not look like puke, it’s a beautiful name: B-E-I-G-H-L-E-I-G-H is her name, and it is pronounced like Bailey,” said Jackson.
“Math is weird. I get why you think my name looks like puke,” said Ms. Beighleigh. “But we’re going in circles. Let’s get to the point: you came here to attend my class.”
“Well, yes, but we’re also here to find my mom’s lost love,” said Anita.
“Lost love? Oh, THAT lost love? The lost love of Dad Shape in the 800s?” said Ms. Beighleigh.
“How’d you know?” said Anita.
“I watch the news,” said Beighleigh. “Speaking of the news, my phone just buzzed because of the news.”
“What does it say?” said Jackson.
“It says that a dragon has been defeated for the first time ever,” said Beighleigh.
“That’s amazing!” said Anita.
“It sure is an incredible feat,” said Beighleigh.
“No, it’s amazing because we could do that!” said Anita.
“Don’t get too ahead of yourself; dragons breathe fire, and they are really big,” said Beighleigh. “Let me get back to teaching my class. The kids are already here.”
5 students walked up to Ms. Beighlegh’s school.
“Those kids look a little young,” said Anita, “but it was a free course, and we love free things!”
“Alright class, I’ll call roll, and we’ll have fun!”
The teacher took the roll, and Anita fell asleep. This is how her dream went.

<b>Chapter</b> 7: The Dream

“Now, everyone tell me three fun facts about yourself,” said the teacher.
“Is this class meant for kindergarteners?” said Anita.
Facts were said by students. Anita and Jackson refused.
“Anita and Jackson, why are you not answering?” said the teacher.
“Because we’re too big for kindergarten,” said Anita and Jackson.
“Well, you do look quite big, so I guess I’ll let this one slide. On with the lesson. You see kids, points are actually infinitely small, but they each have souls that carry their clothing. They wear this clothing so you can see them.”
“Interesting!” said Anita. “I wonder what else we’ll learn. I also wonder why the teacher has red eyes all of a sudden. Is she evil?”
“Next topic, Angle DIE, which I will make everyone coplanar with! FEEL. MY. RAGE!!” said Beighleigh.
“Yep, she’s evil! RUN!” said Anita
The raging Beighleigh was swinging her pointing stick like a weapon.
“Alright, it’s only a melee weapon. She can't get me from up here,” said Anita.
“Not if I give you a DESK!” said Beighleigh.
Beighleigh launched a desk at Anita. It was from then on that Anita knew that Beighleigh had magical powers. Anita and Jackson ran through the city, dodging desk after desk, miraculously staying alive. Beighleigh’s rage grew even stronger.
“YOU SHALL DIE!” Beighleigh said, magically commanding a desk towards Anita and Jackson.
“Oh no I won’t,” said Jackson, running into a building with Anita.
Anita and Jackson ran through the lobby of that building, pushing line segments out of their way.
“Excuse us,” Anita said.
They climbed up sets of stairs until they got to the 5th floor. There, they tripped on a toy and fell into a portal.
“What is happening?” said Anita.
“I DON’T KNOW!” said Jackson.
“Hey you guys, welcome to our store! Wait, I swear I just saw some figures. Where did they go?” said a store clerk.
“Ah, we’ve landed. Where are we?” said Anita.
Anita and Jackson were in a new plane now: Plane WHY. In this plane, math-doers roamed about. One of them went up to Anita and Jackson.
“Hello,” said the math-doer.
“AHHH!” said Anita and Jackson.
“Don’t fret, I’m here to help,” said the math-doer. “I’m Madson. Madison Johnson. But you can just call me Maddie."
“Oh, you’re NICE? This is unheard of!” said Jackson.
“Yes, I am nice, and I have heard about your situation. Your mom has lost her love, and the Great Point of your world needs true love’s intersection.”
“Wait, there are OTHER Great Points?” said Anita.
“Yes. Every geometrical plane has a Great Point. I even have my own plane, right here!”
Maddie stuck the plane into Plane WHY.
“Wow, a plane intersecting another plane? I’ve never seen that,” said Anita.
“Yes, and you should come into the real world,” said Maddie.
“But what about Plane ABC? And what even IS the real world, anyway?”
“The real world is a place with actual students who do math,” said Maddie, “and you can always draw Plane ABC later.”
“Okay,” said Anita. Jackson did not come.
In the real world, Anita saw a glimpse of her mom’s lost love. He was beautiful. But before Anita could bring her back, a voice called out, and the dream got lucid.
“Hello, little wee point,” said the voice. “This is your mother’s lost love, but you do not have enough knowledge to save her. When you obtain the knowledge, we shall battle in the 800s, that is, if you actually get there. WHICH YOU WILL NOT!”
Anita hopped out of the window, falling further and further, and at the last second, the school bell rang, and Anita woke up.

<b>Chapter</b> 8: Time in The City
“That was a wild dream. I saw Mom’s lost love! The only thing is, I don’t have enough knowledge,” said Anita.
“Wait, you saw your mom’s lost love?” said Jackson.
“Yes,” said Anita. “We just need to find the right knowledge.”
“You want knowledge? I know where to get knowledge,” said Jackson. “We just enroll in the local school and learn.”
“But that costs too much money,” said Anita.
“No problem, we can just get a job at the local fast food place,” said Jackson.
“And how much does that pay, exactly?” said Anita.
“22 bucks an hour,” said Jackson, “and we have as much time as we want.”
“No we don’t! Remember my mom?” said Anita.
“Oh, right,” said Jackson. “Didn’t you bring money?”
“Yeah, but I spent it all on a bathroom,” said Anita.
“Why a bathroom? I can build bathrooms, remember?” said Jackson. “And I kind of need to go all of a sudden. If I had a midpoint, it would have a lot of pee in it. So okay, I’ll check out your bathroom if you want me to. Stay there, okay?”
Jackson went to Anita’s bathroom.
“Man, this place is trash!” said Jackson.
That was what he felt until he saw a geometry textbook inside.
“This is a good find. Let me build my own bathroom so I don’t have to use Anita’s. Then I’ll take this textbook back to Anita.”
Jackson went back to Anita and showed her the textbook.
“This is it! We can learn about geometry! Then we shall find your mom’s lost love and return to your house!” said Jackson. “And that sunset is beautiful!”
“Yes, let’s do it! But not before a quick night exploring everything this city has to offer!” said Anita.
“First on our list: clothing,” said Jackson. “I see a clothing store right over there!”
They went into the clothing store. There, they met a nicely dressed right triangle.
“Hey, are you looking for some nice new drip? Then you’ve hit up the right guy! Get it, cause I’m a right triangle?”
“Sorry, Mr. Triangle, but-”
“You don’t see any drip you like? Well we’re here to change that! Let’s make this little point and square here the most geometrically drippy decked out figures anyone has ever drawn! So here we have jackets,” said the triangle.
“Ooh, I want a jacket,” said Jackson.
“You can get it! Which one would you like!”
“Mmm, that one,” said Jackson, pointing to a dark red coat, the type that a motorcyclist would wear in order to make an entrance.
“And you, Anita?” said the triangle.
“I see a dress that I really like,” said Anita, pointing across the room to a pink dress.
“You can get it! Let’s head over there now!”
They went to the dresses. Anita picked up her pink dress and then Anita, Jackson, and the triangle headed to checkout.
“Now it’s time to pay, hope you have a nice day!”, said the triangle.
Anita and Jackson paid for their clothes, then left the clothing store.
“Where should we go next?” said Anita.
“I’m getting a little hungry. Maybe we should go to a restaurant,” said Jackson. “And I see one right there!”
“Sounds good,” said Anita.
They entered the restaurant. There, they saw an old man. He was seemingly human, and Anita had read in the textbook that there are only two humans on the plane ABC: Pythagoras and Euclid. This one looked like Pythagoras though.
“Well hello hello hello hello hello to you you you you you there! I’m Popstar Pythagoras!” said the man.
“Last thing I knew you weren’t a pop star, and I listen to pop,” said Anita.
“Oh, that’s just my entrance to get people to come here,” said Pythagoras. “No one ever does, though.”
“That’s sad. Hey, I read about your theorem you tweeted about on Twitter, and I can't believe I’m actually meeting the man who made it! I just don’t know how to use it,” said Jackson.
“Well, it couldn’t be easier! Here, I’ll show you,” said Pythagoras, pulling out a whiteboard and a marker. He then drew a right triangle; a triangle with one right angle. “This is a right triangle,” he said.
“Is this 3rd grade or what?” said Jackson.
“Oh, it’s not 3rd grade. But I must keep going. Can anyone tell me what the longest side of this triangle is called?” said Pythagoras.
“I know! The hypotenuse!” said Anita. “I learned it from a textbook my friend got me.”
“Very good! Now, we’ll call the hypotenuse C, and these other sides A and B. Knowing that, we can say that a2 + b2 = c2, which you’ve probably seen.”
“Yeah, go square! Go, go, go square!” said Anita.
“Yes, that is the meme that went viral on TikTok,” said Pythagoras. “But can anyone give me a real example?”
“When A and B are 3 and 4, C is 5. Because 3 squared equals 9 and 4 squared equals 16, we get 25 when we add them together. The square root of 25 is 5. Hence, 5.”
“Very nice! Oh, and I ordered you guys food. It should be here any second,” said Pythagoras.
“And we’ve got some beef, some burgers, and some BASS, both the fish and the instrument!” said a waitress, pulling out a bass guitar and playing a big juicy riff that was probably more delicious than the food itself.
“Nice bass!” said Anita and Jackson.
“I’ve been practicing. And also I’ve played bass my whole life. My name is Elizabeth but everyone calls me Elizabass because of my bass,” said Elizabass. “Bye bye, bon appetit, and BASS!”
“Well, that was something. Hey, I heard you guys lost your dad,” said Pythagoras.
“We lost our mom’s lost love,” said Anita. “Well, I lost my mom’s lost love.”
“Well, I think I know where he is,” said Pythagoras.
“You do?” said Anita.
“He’s with old Mister Euclid in the 800s,” said Pythagoras.
“Euclid. I read about him in a textbook I found, and now that you mention it, I think I saw him in a dream,” said Anita.
“Tell me all about it,” said Pythagoras.
“Well, I was in what looked like a room. It had desks, and what might have been that Euclid guy. He said I didn’t have enough knowledge,” said Anita.
“Well, now I think you do! Come on, let’s catch a taxi to x-coordinate 400 and face whatever dragons might be there!” said Pythagoras.
“OK!” said Anita and Jackson.

<b>Chapter</b> 9: The Spoiled Brat

Anita, Jackson, and Pythagoras were riding in their taxi when suddenly a scooting child came.
“Mom, I want that taxi,” he said.
“Oh, I don’t want to hit that kiddo,” said Pythagoras. “Better stop.”
The kid didn’t move.
“Mom, I want their clothes, that textbook, and everything else they have. If I don’t get it, I will cry.” the kid said.
“You can’t have everything, son,” his mom said.
“Yes I can, or my name’s not Owen. Jokes on you, my name doesn’t owe anyone any money, so my name already isn’t owing!” the kid said.
“Aw geez-Elouise! What a pun! Is his name really Owen, though? Is he gonna move?”
“I am not moving until I get that taxi,” said Maybe Owen, “and I have this special new plane maker that makes an invisible plane that can be made real in certain places, and I will make it real across this street only!”
Plane KID formed, and started intersecting Plane ABC.
“Well now what?” said Pythagoras.
“I guess just wait in the back until this kid leaves,” said Anita.
“I know!” said Jackson. “I can build a bathroom in front of Maybe Owen!”
“Jackson, that won’t work,” said Anita.
Jackson built a bathroom, then got carried away and built 19 more, all in the span of 1 minute.
“Whoa, potty, whoapotty, whoa, whoa, whoa…” said Maybe Owen.
“This kid builds bathrooms?!” said Maybe Owen’s mom.
“Yep, it’s kinda my thing.” said Jackson. “But I’ve gotta go now.”
“How are we gonna get over this wall?” said Anita.
“Bathrooms? I can build bathrooms over it,” said Jackson.
“No, bathrooms won’t work,” said Anita.
Bathrooms worked.

<b>Chapter</b> 10: The Ride

Anita, Jackson, and Pythagoras were now building their way to 800 x above the city. They were at 500 z.
“Man, this guy can really build.” said Pythagoras. “I mean, floating bathrooms? How do you do it?”
“It’s simple. I just use floating bathroom powder. I get it from the old magic shop at my house,” said Jackson.
“Wait, magic? Are you talking about math?” said Pythagoras.
“Yes, math magic. I basically turn the bathrooms into figures that are not affected by gravity, like a still image, just, everything else is still moving,” said Jackson, all while building floating bathroom after floating bathroom.
“Hey, have you guys ever heard of perpendicularity?” said Pythagoras, “because I just saw perpendicular lines in a far-off plane.”
“No, what is it?” said Anita.
“Perpendicularity is when two lines intersect at right angles,” said Pythagoras, “and it doesn’t really happen on Plane ABC. But up here, we can see it just fine. Look, there’s line AB and line RT being perpendicular.”
“And I can see perpendicular lines JK and QU on what looks like a plane that is parallel to the plane that line AB and line RT are on!” said Anita.
“Can’t talk. Going through some rough air for bathroom builders. And what is that, a dragon? Oh no, build a platform!” said Jackson.
“Math dragons. I’ve defeated one of them, but so far that has been the only time a dragon has been defeated.” said Pythagoras.
“Oh so YOU were the guy on the news!” said Jackson.
“Yes, I was showered with attention. Speaking of showers, A FIRE SHOWER IS HAPPENING!” said Pythagoras.
Anita and Jackson stepped out of the way. The dragon blew more fire.
“How shall we defeat this dragon?” Anita said. “I was thinking bass, since Elizabass’s bass solo just came into my mind.”
“Did someone say BASS?” said Elizabass. “Quick, get me a hoverboard!”
As Elizabass was flying up, fireballs flew her way. But when she played bass, they seemed to disappear like they were never there in the first place.
“Ah! Um! Play those strings! Play that nice music!” said Elizabass.

<b>Chapter</b> 11: BASS (and a battle)

“My strings are parallel, I’m doing well!” said Elizabass. Her music was like lines in the sky.
“Hit that with Line BA, make it parallel to the grid, yeah it’s horizontal and some damage is what I did! Ooh, bass, lyrics, pow!” said Elizabass.
When Elizabass arrived on Jackson’’s platform, she felt she needed to pee.
“Man oh man do I have to pee!” said Elizabass.
“Well this platform is also a bathroom!” said Jackson.
“I can pee and be free on this thing that’s here for me? Bass solo!” said Elizabass, doing a bass solo while going to the bathroom.
Elizabass’s bass was coming from the bathroom.
“Guys, this is some good bass!” said Jackson.
When Elizabass got out, she played some bass for the dragon.
“Take this line! Line ME with bass, perpendicular to your face! Parallel with the platform comes Line YT, fresh out the oven for you and me! Ooh, ahh, bass!”
“Man, this is EPIC bass,” said Pythagoras, who began dancing.
“When people get in my groove, the groove only gets stronger. Play your games, dragon, I can play a LOT longer! Ya, ooh, ha, bass solo!” said Elizabass, playing the most epic bass solo ever. But the dragon wasn’t giving up. And Pythagoras was STILL dancing.
“I’m not giving up! I am a fighter and a bass player! Ooh, yuh, bass!” said Elizabass.
But, after hours of fighting, Elizabass had no more bass in her. The dragon was nearly dead, though. And Pythagoras was STILL dancing.
“Ohh, I’m tired, bass, bass, bass,” said Elizabass.
“Pythagoras, why are you still dancing?” said Anita.
“Because this groove is great! Wait, there’s no groove. All I see is FIRE!” said Pythagoras.
They jumped out of the way. 
“Hey, I can build a death laser bathroom,” said Jackson. “All I would need is some of that dragon’s fire,” said Jackson.
“Dude, you can’t build a death potty!” said Anita.
“Gimme that bass, please,” said Jackson.
“Okay,” said Elizabass.
Jackson played a bass solo, and then he built a bathroom. His bass lured the dragon into breathing into his bathroom. Then he built a death ray out of the scorched bathroom.
“See, death ray! Now, all I need is to aim and FIRE!” said Jackson.
The dragon died due to Jackson’s death ray.
“What a legend,” said Anita. “You defeated that dragon with a BATHROOM? How?”
“Going pee, it’s kinda my thing,” said Jackson. “But look over there! Our platform must have moved, because I see your mom’s lost love! Quick, take these parachutes that I just built!”
And with that, Anita and her crew were off to save James.

<b>Chapter</b> 12: Euclid

When Anita and her crew landed, they saw a strong tough dude.
“I am Euclid. I assume you’ve come here because of the dream you had,” said the dude.
“How did you know that?” said Anita.
“Well, I placed it there. I placed it there because I knew you were coming for James, but nothing ever is free in life,” said Euclid.
“Hey Euclid, nice to see you again,” said Pythagoras.
“Py-Py? Who brought you here?”
“We did,” said Anita, Jackson, and Elizabass.
“Well, I respect that. I also respect everything else I’ve heard. Floating bathrooms, dragon-killing bass, and some other stuff. How do you do it?” said Euclid.
“It’s simple. Floating bathroom powder. I’ll show you,” said Jackson, putting floating bathroom powder on Euclid, making him float.
“Whoa!” said Euclid, going bye-bye.
“Now we can save James and get the Great Point a line!” said Jackson.
“Did someone say James? Are you guys talking about me?” said James.
“Hey, James. I remember you from when I was a little girl,” said Anita.
“Anita Shape, that’s your name, right?” said James.
“Yes, and we were wondering-”
“Say no more. I’ll be right home as soon as I can find a way home,” said Jackson.
“Hey Mr. James. I’m Jackson,” said Jackson.
“THE Jackson? The one who builds bathrooms?” said James.
“Yep, that’s me,” said Jackson, “and I can build a quick bathroom home after I get one of those lines to come with us. Hey lines! Does anyone need to pee?”
“Why lines?” said James.
“The Great Point needs help,” said Jackson.
At that moment, a line came up. “I need to pee!” he said.
“Well, hop on in!” said Jackson. “Just need to add some teleporting bathroom powder, have it teleport to Anita’s house, and boom!”
And with that, they were at their home.
“Just need to give this line to the Great Point,” said Jackson.
“I got it,” said the line, perfectly intersecting the Great Point and breaking his curse.
“What is this? Could it be? Am I saved? I’m saved!” said the Great Point.
Anita and her crew then had dinner at Anita’s house.
“Come on in for a group hug,” said Jackson.
“Okay,” said Anita, Pythagoras, and Elizabass, going in for the hug.
“I love you guys,” said Jackson.
“We love you too.” said the rest of the crew.
And Anita Shape lived a happy life with her newfound friends Jackson, Elizabass, and Pythagoras.

NOTES

The line y=10 is parallel to the line that Elizabass made in the line “ ‘Hit that with Line BA, make it parallel to the grid, yeah it’s horizontal and some damage is what I did! Ooh, bass, lyrics, pow!’ said Elizabass.” on the plane that includes 2 points on y=10 and 1 point on the aforementioned line. It is, of course, parallel to the x-axis. And lastly, Elizabass’s strings are parallel.

NARRATIVE-RELATED NOTES

Plane DEF was all a myth.
