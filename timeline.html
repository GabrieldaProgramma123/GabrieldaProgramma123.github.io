        <p class="bigText" id="bossbar">Once upon a time there was a princess. One day, a witch trapped her in a tower. And she was stuck there forever. Or was she? The law of conservation of matter states that matter cannot be created or destroyed, and the princess is made of matter, so as she dies, her molecular composition could form something else, like another princess. That princess could then live happily ever after. Allow me to make a timeline of “The Princess who Cheated Death by Dying and Having Her Matter Form Another Princess.”</p>
        <p class="bigText" id="healthbar">We shall run this in the fantasy worlds of these shows and books: Ben and Holly’s Little Kingdom, Goldie and Bear, Kingdom of Wrenly, and Little Charmers. We will also run this in a realistic world and a traditional fairytale world.</p>

        <p class="bigText">Assumptions:
The princess weighs 50 kg.
The princess doesn’t have a funeral.
She is 16 years old when she is trapped.

Note: Bones are made of calcium phosphate and carbonate(60) + collagen(30) + water(10). The princess’s skeleton weighs 11 kg.

0 seconds - story starts.
15 minutes - princess messes with witch
20 minutes - witch traps princess in tower
70 yrs 20 minutes - princess dies
70 years 25 days 20 minutes - princess releases 1600 g nitrogen, 500 g phosphorus, 200 g potassium, and 50 g magnesium, according to Wikipedia.
90 years 25 days 20 minutes - bones fully decay, princess at this point: 1600 g nitrogen, 500 g phosphorus, 200 g potassium, 50 g magnesium, 3.3 g calcium phosphate, 3.3 g calcium carbonate, 3.3 g collagen, and 1.1 g water.

We’re missing some stuff. This can’t form a princess.

Google AI told me that a human cell randomly forming is a 1 in 1040,000 chance. It got this from a
scientist named Fred Hoyle. But in our example, which is fantasy, nothing is impossible. It’s basically zero, but it’s not zero yet! But, with all this time we’re spending, I should think about the tower. What would happen to it? Nah, best not to think about it.

Let’s say a “chance” happens once every second. There is a 1 in 1040000 chance for one cell to form. According to a different blog, there are 1014 cells in a human body. One last thing, our dead princess is made up of 8.34 x 10^25 atoms. 

So, the chance of a new princess forming is 1 in 10^1,480,000,000,000,000,000, according to a quick AI calculation. And the best part is that we have bigger numbers! Look at googolplex, for example. It is 10 to the googol power, and googol is 10^100. The big number up there? It’s power isn’t even close to a googol. 

Now, a chance happens every second, so according to another quick AI calc, it would take ((10^1,480,000,000,000,000,000) - 7.5) years. This is not forever, in fact, it’s still only 0% to infinity!

        <p class="bigText">In fantasy, some curses are described as able to last “forever.” This usually happens because of midnight happening, or the full moon. But since we have such big numbers, let’s talk about the heat death of the universe and magic. When the universe dies, (if it dies) what happens to eternal curses? Do they end? It kinda depends. If the curse is placed on a living being, then the curse could end when the being dies. This is okay in most cases, because it’s normally a character (or characters) that we care about that gets cursed. And if those characters die, then it’s a sad ending in most cases. But in our case, it’s not. We want to know what happens to the dead body of the cursed character. Is it still cursed? It’s not quite clear, because authors tend not to include details that are not important to the story. Death is an ending, and since what’s after the ending is not the story, and thus not important to it, the author doesn’t include those details.

Now let’s talk about kingdoms. When a kingdom is cursed, potentially eternally, does the curse apply to the molecular composition of the kingdom, or does it apply to whatever area the royals control and rule over? If the first option is true, then that magic might stay until heat death, but the second option states that if, for example, the kingdom is conquered and ceases to exist, the magic would have no effect. It would still be there, and it might stay until heat death, but it would do nothing.

But would the heat death remove magic? And what happens to immortal beings that were made immortal via magic? Let’s talk about it and other magic that involves time, including a major discovery I made when at my babysitter’s house.

Let’s talk about that discovery first. But you have to know a little bit about what happened first. My babysitter is Cuban, and she brought me to her apartment today. Her husband has Disney+, which allowed me to watch the show Goldie and Bear. It was in Spanish, but the subtitles were in English. The episode I watched was called Goldie’s Do-Over Day, and it involves a do-over spell. But what’s interesting about this do-over spell is it isn’t actually a proper time rewind spell, but a mass teleportation spell. It’s a powder, and to activate it, you throw it and say “do-over.” What happens is every object and living thing gets teleported to where it was at a previous time. I assume it also can create things, because it wouldn’t be good if there was a mistake it couldn’t fix. You see where this is going? I use magic to use the powder during the universe’s heat death. I use magic because nothing can happen without magic, and there are things that need to happen for the powder to activate. It then returns the objects that once existed. Like I said, it doesn’t rewind time, so we can keep waiting for our princess to form.
